## Description

### Data Overview

 - This directory contains data obtained from HGNC. The hgnc_complete_set is a set of all approved gene symbol reports found on the GRCh38 reference and the alternative reference loci (see fig. 2 for a list of columns/headings). Each complete set file is updated on a monthly basis and combined into a single parquet file in the brick, ``data/combined_HGNC_data.parquet``  
 - The data is stored in parquet format. Descriptions for columns for each of the HGNC data tables are listed below. 
 - The data was obtained from the following link http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/genenames/hgnc/archive/
